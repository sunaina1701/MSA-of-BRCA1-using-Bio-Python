## Multiple Sequence Alignment of BRCA1 using BioPython

This project performs multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of BRCA1 gene sequences using BioPython. It demonstrates how to fetch sequence data, align sequences, and visualize the alignment.

## Project Overview

BRCA1 is a crucial gene involved in DNA repair. Mutations in BRCA1 are linked to breast and ovarian cancers. This repository aims to show how to align BRCA1 sequences from different organisms or sources using Python and BioPython libraries.

## Features

Fetch BRCA1 sequences from NCBI or local FASTA files

Perform multiple sequence alignment using ClustalW or Muscle

Visualize alignment results

Save alignment to a file for further analysis


## Tools and Libraries

Python

BioPython

NCBI Entrez

ClustalW or Muscle (externally installed)


## Getting Started

Clone the repository and make sure BioPython is installed:

!pip install biopython


## Acknowledgements
